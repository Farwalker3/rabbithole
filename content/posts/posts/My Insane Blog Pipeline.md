## Obsidian
I got this idea from a [Network Chuck](https://www.youtube.com/@NetworkChuck) video. The idea starts with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a markdown note taking application loved by many. This is where I will be writing my blog posts.
## The Pipeline
Once I've written my blog posts, they will be uploaded to Github, and then hosted on the web for all to see using a hosting provider of my choice.
## How It Looks

## The Goal
The goal of this blog is to test out an idea. I will give this idea a try, and if I like it, I may continue blogging.
